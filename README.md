This is the official repository for the **CVPR 2026** paper "[A Stitch in Time: Learning Procedural Workflow via Self-Supervised Plackett-Luce Ranking](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2511.17805)".

PL-Stitch is an image foundation model that captures visual changes over time, enabling procedural activity understanding. It takes an image as input and produces a feature vector as output, leveraging the novel Plackett-Luce temporal ranking objective to build a comprehensive understanding of both the static semantic information and the procedural context within procedural videos.

Abstract
--------
Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.

🔧 Install dependencies
--------------------------------------------------

Install the following dependencies in your local setup:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:visurg-ai/PL-Stitch.git
   cd PL-Stitch && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


🗂️ Data preparation
-------------------
Download the pretraining dataset ([LEMON](https://github.com/visurg-ai/LEMON)) and evaluation datasets ([Cholec80](https://camma.unistra.fr/datasets/), [AutoLaparo](https://autolaparo.github.io/), [M2CAI16](https://camma.unistra.fr/datasets/), [Breakfast](https://serre.lab.brown.edu/breakfast-actions-dataset.html), [GTEA](https://cbs.ic.gatech.edu/fpv/)).

For efficient data loading, we use the LMDB format by default. To process these datasets into LMDB, run the following code for both pretraining and evaluation.


```bash
bash scripts/covert_lmdb.sh
```


🚀 Pretraining
-----------
We provide scripts to pretrain the PL-Stitch model using either LMDB or raw video files.

1. To pretrain using LMDB:
```bash
bash scripts/pretrain_lmdb.sh --data_path "/path/to/your/dataset.lmdb"
```

2. To pretrain using raw videos:
```bash
bash scripts/pretrain_video.sh --data_path "/path/to/your/videos_folder"
```



📊 Evaluation
--------------
We provide a script for the downstream task evaluation.
```bash
bash scripts/eval.sh
```

🚩 PL-Stitch model
------------------

You can download the checkpoint at [🤗 PL-Stitch](https://huggingface.co/visurg/PL-Stitch/blob/main/pl_lemon.pth) and run the following code to extract features from your video frames.


   ```python
   import torch
   from PIL import Image
   from pl_stitch.build_model import build_model

   # Load the pre-trained pl_stitch model
   pl_stitch = build_model(pretrained_weights = 'your path to the model')
   pl_stitch.eval()

   # Load the image and convert it to a PyTorch tensor
   img_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
   img = Image.open(img_path)
   img = img.resize((224, 224))
   img_tensor = torch.tensor(np.array(img)).unsqueeze(0).to('cuda')

   # Extract features from the image
   outputs = pl_stitch(img_tensor)
   ```
